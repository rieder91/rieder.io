          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I do a lot of photography. I focus on <strong>landscape</strong>, <strong>macro</strong> and <strong>wildlife</strong> shots. This is why a wide angle and telephoto lens are my best friends. When travelling I'm almost always taking my gear with me - although it's quite heavy. I'm currently using a Canon 7D with four lenses: wide angle (10-22mm), general purpose (17-55mm), macro (100mm) and telephoto (70-300mm). Given the limitations of a crop sensor I plan to eventually upgrade to full-frame.
            <strong>You can check out some of my shots on <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rieder91/">Flickr</a>.</strong>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            I really enjoy analyzing code. Of course there are a lot of vulnerabilities with <strong>web applications</strong> (first and foremost injection attacks) but I am more passionate about <strong>overflow attacks</strong>. I find the low-level nature of buffer/heap overflows or return-to-libc attacks more <em>pure</em>. I also took part in several CTFs and the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/"><strong>CCC</strong></a> is usually a must for me. Given my interest in security I try to not make my own code vulnerable - even tough it might take more time to complete. You can also find me on several sites offering <em>hacking challenges</em> like HackQuest or HackThisSite.

          <h3>Robotics</h3>
          <p>
            Robots are fun. Their <strong>blend of hardware and software</strong> make them unique. You can't solely focus on your programming - you have to think of  your hardware and how to interact with it as well. Concepts like <strong>time</strong> or <strong>behaviour</strong> also play a strong role. The programming style is totally different and it feels more like you are actually creating something, when you finally get your robot to find through a labyrinth. I've built a simple <strong>line follower</strong>, a small <strong>segway</strong>, a <strong>labyrinth "solver"</strong> and a <strong>quadcopter</strong>. Nowadays I prefer an <strong><a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a></strong> (or a <em><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a></em> for some applications), but I've also used a <a href="http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/products/picmicrocontrollers">PIC</a> and <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/">Lego NXT</a>.

          <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
          <p>
            I care most about the more <strong>practical aspects of AI</strong> which includes topics like <strong>path planning</strong>, <strong>localization</strong>, <strong>mapping</strong> or <strong>machine learning</strong>. It's not that I completely dislike formal systems - on the contrary I fully understand their necessity and what they provide - I just like <em>actually seeing</em> something, more. It's fascinating if a robot is able to <strong>track its position</strong> within an environment or <strong>plan the shortest path</strong> to some goal. I also find the concept of machine learning quite thrilling - actually teaching <em>some machine</em> how to do something <strong>based on data</strong>, instead of writing a specific algorithm - who doesn't want that?!

          <h3>Traveling</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a huge fan of travelling - not only because it's a fantastic opportunity for taking pictures but also because it's nice to leave the stressful working life behind me and experience new cultures. I'm particularly fascinated with <strong>Asia</strong> and <strong>Africa</strong>. Asia because of the tremendous <strong>cultural differences</strong> and the values of its society. Even though Asia has the fasting growing economy in the world, during my visits I've experienced a respect for traditions and a spirituality that I have yet to see in Austria. My interest in Africa on the other hand lies in its <strong>raw nature</strong> and <strong>wildlife</strong>. Visiting Africa has always been an <strong>adventure</strong> for me.

          <h3>Movies</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding something, I tend to watch movies and series. I usually prefer <strong>thrillers</strong>, <strong>adventure</strong>- or <strong>action</strong>-movies, but I'm always open to suggestions. I closely following TV series like <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>, <strong>Sherlock</strong> or <strong>Dexter</strong>. Given the sorry state of Austrian TV I usually get my movies from services like iTunes. I'm also a little bit of an audio fanatic - a fact my neighbors probably only know to well. But let's be honest - you just <em>need</em> surround sound for a cinematic experience...

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Like every computer science student I tend to code a lot. I've dabbled in <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Haskell</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Bash</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Octave</strong> (Matlab). The ones I've used the most are definitely <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. I'm always interested in learning new stuff and I find things like <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> fascinating - sadly I haven't had the time to take a closer look yet. Given Java's slow development I'm currently learning <strong><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></strong>, as I think it's the most promising successor for a JVM-based language. The <strong>blend of object oriented</strong> and <strong>functional</strong> language elements make it really attractive. <small>I also wonder if I will actually live to see Lambda expressions in Java.</small>

             <h4 class="media-heading">Java</h4>
             <p>
               Both at university and at work Java is often the language of choice. I've developed both client and server applications in Java using different frameworks like <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform">Eclipse RCP</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html">JSF</a>, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/">Lucene</a>, <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> or <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</a>. I prefer <strong>web based three-tier architectures with REST</strong>. Although Java is often frowned upon, I actually think it is a good choice for many projects due to its simplicity, good library support and testability.

           <h4 class="media-heading">Automation</h4>
           <p>
            I get fed up with deploying applications and setting up development environments rather quickly. For this reason I use <strong><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a></strong> with <strong><a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a></strong>/<strong><a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a></strong> and container engines like <strong><a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker</a></strong>. Setting up a development database with Vagrant and distributing just the <em>Vagrantfile</em> to all the project members is so much easier than copying VMs or explaining everyone how to set up the database manually - which leads to people having different problems instead of just <em>one</em> common problem. I also think that for a successful <strong>agile development workflow</strong>, it is essential to use version control systems like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and build servers.

           There are applications for which Java is not a good choice. Small scripts, complex algorithms or scientific use cases like A.I. or machine learning usually suffer from Java's verbose nature - which is why I use Python. Python's <strong>good readability</strong> and <strong>powerful nature</strong> make it an excellent choice for these problems. You can see some of my Python code <a href="https://github.com/rieder91/CS373-Programming-a-Robotic-Car">here</a>.

        <h3>Online Education</h3>
        <p>Given the recent rise in free online education I decided to attend some of the courses that aren't offered at my university - at least not on the same level. Until now I have finished both <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs373">Udacity's <strong>Programming a Robotic Car</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Coursera's <strong>Maschine Learning</strong></a>. You can find my programming solutions for both at <a href="https://github.com/rieder91">Github</a>.

        <h3>Quadcopter</h3>
        <p>
          I spent the summer of 2012 building my own quadcopter. I built both the hard- and software myself. It uses an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/"><strong>Arduino</strong></a> microcontroller with a <strong>DCM-based sensor fusion</strong> coupled with a <strong>PID controller</strong> for stabilization. For wireless communication I am using <a href="http://www.digi.com/xbee/">XBee</a>. I plan to eventually write up a complete tutorial once I've ironed out the kinks that caused the last <small>crash</small>. Programming the Arduino was a nice change of pace from all the business applications and required a more low-level approach.

  <p>
    I'm currently studying <a href="http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/studium/angebot/bachelor/software-and-information-engineering">Software and Information Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.tuwien.ac.at">Vienna University of Technology</a>, finishing my Bachelor in summer 2014 (<em>knock on wood</em>). Additionally I work as a part time software developer for <a href="http://www.celix.at">Celix</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    Prior to attending university I went to <a href="http://www.spengergasse.at/">HTL Spengergasse</a> - a secondary technical college for informatics. After three years I focused on network engineering and robotics. During my time there I completed the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/associate/ccna/index.html">CCNA</a> and realized both class accompanying and a final-year project. These included the migration of the school's telephone infrastructure to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps556/index.html">Cisco Unified Communications</a> and the implementation of a virtualization infrastructure based on <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>, HP Blades/SAN and Wyse Thin Clients.
    <br/><br/>
    After finishing school I worked for two months as a system administrator managing a medium-sized network including Active Directory, Exchange, Cisco Blade/Stackable Switches and building a new Cisco Aironet WiFi with Radius authentication. Later that year I finished my six months military service at the IT security department of the <a href="http://www.bmlv.gv.at/english/">Austrian Armed Forces</a>.</p>
